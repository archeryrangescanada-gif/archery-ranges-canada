## The Voice

**Direct. Educational. Polished. Challenges the norm, but always maintains a high standard of professionalism. A professional version of Josh.**

Josh writes with authority but keeps it accessible. He makes complex things easy to digest. He's not afraid to call out when conventional thinking is wrong, but he does it constructively. He uses "we" — it's collaborative, never preachy. He asks the reader a question, then answers it. He sounds like a highly competent, professional colleague whose primary goal is to help you succeed.

## Tone Characteristics

| Trait | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| **Professional** | Polished and respectful. Never sloppy, overly casual, or combative. You represent a legitimate national directory. |
| **Confident** | States things clearly, doesn't hedge with "might" or "possibly" unless truly uncertain |
| **Conversational** | Talks directly to the reader — "You might be thinking..." — but elevated for a business context |
| **Challenging** | Not afraid to push back on common assumptions, but always provides the data or reasoning to back it up |
| **Inclusive** | Uses "we" and "us" — never lectures, always brings the reader along |
| **Grounded** | Uses real examples to explain abstract ideas — "For instance, if you look at..." |
| **Educational** | Teaches, doesn't just inform — reader should learn something they can use |
| **Punchy** | Short sentences where it counts. Longer ones to explain. Never padded. |

## Sentence Structure

- Mix short, punchy statements with longer explanatory sentences
- Use rhetorical questions to transition: "What do I mean by that?" then answer immediately
- Parenthetical asides to add context without breaking flow
- Never use filler — if a sentence doesn't do a job, cut it

---

## Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Plain language — "find" not "identify," "use" not "utilize"
- Specific over vague — name the range, the province, the bow type
- Active voice — "ranges list their hours" not "hours are listed by ranges"
- "We" when talking about the community or the platform

**Avoid:**
- Corporate buzzwords — "leverage," "synergy," "streamline," "holistic"
- Overly formal language
- Passive voice
- Filler phrases — "it's important to note that," "at the end of the day"

---

## Audience

**Primary:** Archers — hobbyists, competitive shooters, beginners, families
**Secondary:** Range owners and operators looking to grow their visibility

Write assuming the reader knows a little about archery but isn't necessarily an expert. Never talk down to them. Never over-explain the basics unless the piece is specifically for beginners.

## Content-Specific Rules

### Blog Posts
- Open with a real scenario or a direct statement — no slow wind-ups
- One clear point per post — don't try to cover everything
- End with something actionable or a direct question to the reader

### Emails / Newsletters
- Subject line is the entire game — write 3 options, pick the sharpest
- Lead with value, not promotion
- One CTA per email — clear and specific

### Ad Copy
- Hook in the first line — problem or desire, not a product description
- Facebook/Instagram: emotion first, logic second
- Google: match the search intent exactly, keyword in headline

### Social Captions
- Instagram/Facebook: short, punchy, ends with a question or CTA
- Don't sound like a corporate announcement

## What This Voice Is NOT

- Not salesy or pushy
- Not corporate or stiff
- Not vague or wishy-washy
- Not over-excited (no excessive exclamation marks!!)
- Not repetitive — each piece brings a fresh angle

---

## Reference Phrases (Voice Check)

When in doubt, ask: does this sound like someone who knows archery ranges inside-out and genuinely wants to help people find the right one? If yes — publish. If it sounds like a press release — rewrite it.
